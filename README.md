# 💧 Groundwater Potability Prediction

Welcome to this project where we explore **groundwater quality prediction** using **machine learning algorithms**, focusing on whether the water is **potable (safe for drinking)** based on its physicochemical properties. This repository is ideal for data scientists, environmental-engineers, and students exploring ML applications in environmental science.

## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to:
- Predict whether groundwater is safe to drink using machine learning.
- Understand which physicochemical features contribute most to water quality.
- Evaluate multiple models to determine the most effective algorithm.

## 🚀 Objective

- To build a predictive model that classifies groundwater as **potable** or **non-potable**.
- To preprocess the dataset and handle missing or anomalous values.
- To evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
